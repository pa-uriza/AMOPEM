## A Methodology for Option Pricing in Electricity Markets. Case Study: Colombia

Electricity is a commodity that behaves unlike others in the way that cannot be stored cheaply, its transport
depends on existent electrical networks, and can be generated from different sources. This makes the price
of electricity highly volatile. As a risk hedging strategy, various financial instruments have been developed,
among them, options with electric energy as underlying. We developed a methodology for option pricing
in electricity markets, taking into account multi seasonal behaviour. Future electricity prices estimation is
presented for equatorial countries with similar climate conditions like hydro-dependent energy generation
and tropical seasons (e.g. dry season, wet season), affected by El Ni~no Southern Oscillation. We made a
descriptive analysis of the Colombian electricity market. Using mean reversion and mean-reverting jump
diffusion models we made a forecast estimation of intra-day (Hourly) electricity prices based on historical
spot data from Colombian electricity market. The models were calibrated and the estimation of derivatives is
presented and discussed. We concluded that there is no significant difference between modelling seasonality
with dummy variables or with Fourier series and that mean reversion models with jumps perform better at
option pricing.
